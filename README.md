# Low-Light-Image-Denoising-and-Super-Resolution
This just for storage or sharing purpose not for active development
## Overview  
This project implements a deep learning model using a variant of ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) to enhance low-light images. The model is designed to reduce noise, improve resolution, and increase visibility in dark images.  

## Features  
- Enhances low-light images using a deep learning-based approach  
- Reduces noise and artifacts while preserving details  
- Increases image resolution for improved clarity  
- Utilizes a modified version of ESRGAN for better performance  

## Dataset  
The model is trained on a dataset of low-light images with corresponding high-quality ground truth images. It can be adapted to various datasets depending on the use case.  

## Dependencies  
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:
